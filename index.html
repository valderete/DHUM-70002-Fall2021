        <h6>In the inner-city westside of San Antonio, beginning in the 1950’s, a generation of young Chicanos stirred up a cross-cultural blend of popular music genres that included R&B, Doo Wop and Rock N’ Roll, with lesser-known styles, like the regional Conjunto, giving life to the Westside Sound. Decades later, the Westside Sound influence continues to thrive via the more widely known Chicano Soul musical genre. While Chicano Soul music has been well-documented, the story of the Westside Sound is not as well known. This project overviews the geography of San Antonio’s Westside Sound with a focus on the roots, pioneers and prominent places that played a role in the creation and perpetuation of the style. </i></h6>

                <p> True to the name, the Westside Sound refers to a specific geographic area of San Antonio wherein the music thrived however it is important to note that while many of the music’s pioneers were from the Westside of San Anto, not all musical groups or prominant sites that contributed to the music were necessarily from that area – musicians and venues in the Southside, for example, made significant contributions to the music – so the name is multifaceted. Here, we take a look at some prominent venues, record labels, nightclubs, and other places (of the past and present) that contributed and/or continue to contribute to the shaping and perpetuation of the Westside Sound. <p>Click on a marker to learn more about the site.</p></p> </p>
