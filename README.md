# Mapping San Antonio's Westside Sound
True to the name, the Westside Sound refers to a specific geographic area of San Antonio wherein the music thrived however it is important to note that while many of the music’s pioneers were from the Westside of San Anto, not all musical groups or prominant sites that contributed to the music were necessarily from that area – musicians and venues in the Southside, for example, made significant contributions to the music – so the name is multifaceted. Here, we take a look at some prominent venues, record labels, nightclubs, and other places that contributed and/or continue to contribute to the shaping and perpetuation of the Westside Sound.
